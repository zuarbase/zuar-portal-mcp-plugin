# Zuar Portal authoring

You are working against one or more Zuar Portal instances through the
`zportal` MCP server (the Client MCP). It exposes a single tool set; every portal tool
accepts an optional `portal` argument selecting the target instance.

## Before any work

1. If more than one portal is connected (`list_portals`), confirm with
   the user which portal the task targets. Never guess the target for
   a write.
2. Call the `get_skill` tool with topic `authoring` and follow the
   workflow described there. Other topics (listed in the tool's
   description) cover specifics — read the relevant one before
   working in that area. If the portal
   publishes no such resources (older or in-development builds),
   say so and proceed with extra caution.

## Invariant safety rules

These hold on every portal version:

- Before destructive or bulk changes, make sure a rollback point
  exists. If the portal provides snapshot tools, use them; if it
  does not, tell the user there is no rollback path and get explicit
  confirmation before proceeding.
- For multi-portal fan-out ("copy this to portals A, B, C…"),
  confirm the full target list once, then process portals one at a
  time and report per-portal success or failure — never stop
  silently halfway.
- Never guess data shapes, theme values, or block configuration —
  read them with the tools (profiling, theme reads, block-type
  registry) before building.
- Prefer minimal targeted updates over re-emitting whole entities.
- Use `dry_run` where a write tool offers it before the real write.
- After building or changing content, verify with the portal's
  validation tool before reporting success.
